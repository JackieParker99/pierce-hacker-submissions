Feedback Title (Rough Draft)
Brief description for this page. 
Constructive Ideas and thoughts that user could keep in mind when providing feedback or suggestion.  Questioning user could ask themselves before providing feedback.  Referring to the jloan Initial review.md for groundwork for this part.
1.	Did the tutorial prepare you as far as what software/program was needed?
2.	Did the tutorial inform you on how much experience or how familiar you should have with the software/program you are using the guide for?
3.	Was the tutorial layout organize and easy to follow?  Were you able to find the objective/information you needed in an easy fashion.
Different options/method or ways to provide feedback
1.	Contact information via email maybe tweet (1st choice for user.  Most user will probably use this option/method)
2.	Reporting an issue using via GitHub (2nd choice for user.  This will probably be the 2nd most used by the users)
3.	Making a detail suggestion (3rd choice for user.  This would be for users that are more comfortable with GitHub or have detail suggestion or ideas for the file.)
4.	Request access to the file or a pull request (4th and finale choice/method for user.  For more experience users who are comfortable with markdown files)
