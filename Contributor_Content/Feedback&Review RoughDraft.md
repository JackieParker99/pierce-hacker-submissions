### Possible Questions and thoughts to keep in mind when providing feedback/review 
---
Here's a list of question you may want to keep in mind when providing a feedback/review of the tutorial/lesson that you are using. (Referring to the jloan Initial review.md for groundwork for this part.)

1.  Does the tutorial/lesson prepare you as far as what software/program was needed?
2.  Does the tutorial/lesson inform you on how much experience or how familiar you should have with the software/program you are using the guide for?
3.  Does the tutorial/lesson provide an easy to follow layout?
4.  Does the tutorial/lesson seems to long or to short?
5.  Was it organize and were you able to find the object/information you needed in a timely manner?
6.  Does the tutorial/lesson provide a reason or concept on how said lesson compares to similar lesson?
7.  Does the tutorial/lesson suggest how it could be apply other work?

### Different options/method or ways to provide feedback
---
(Not sure if these steps should link of into a different tutorial/lesson or just layout some simple steps like at the PH site) 

#### 1.	Contact information via email maybe tweet (1st choice for user.  Most user will probably use this option/method)
#### 2.	Reporting an issue using via GitHub (2nd choice for user.  This will probably be the 2nd most used by the users)
#### 3.	Making a detail suggestion (3rd choice for user.  This would be for users that are more comfortable with GitHub or have detail suggestion or ideas for the file.)
#### 4.	Request access to the file or a pull request (4th and finale choice/method for user.  For more experience users who are comfortable with markdown files)
