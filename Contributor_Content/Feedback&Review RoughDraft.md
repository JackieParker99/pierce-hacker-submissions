### Possible Questions and thoughts to keep in mind when providing feedback/review

Here's a list of question you may want to keep in mind when providing a feedback/review of the tutorial/lesson that you are using. **(Referring to the jloan Initial review.md for groundwork for this part.)*

1.  Does the tutorial/lesson prepare you as far as what software/program was needed?
2.  Does the tutorial/lesson inform you on how much experience or how familiar you should have with the software/program you are using the guide for?
3.  Does the tutorial/lesson provide an easy to follow layout?
4.  Does the tutorial/lesson seems to long or to short?
5.  Was it organize and were you able to find the object/information you needed in a timely manner?
6.  Does the tutorial/lesson provide a reason or concept on how said lesson compares to similar lesson?
7.  Does the tutorial/lesson suggest how it could be apply other work?

### Different options/method or ways to provide feedback ***(heavily influnce by The Programming Historian)*
---
Here are some ways to leave us your valuable feedback. 

#### 1.	PierceHacker contact information via email or tweet. ***(1st choice for user.  Most user will probably use this option/method)*
Please contact our PierceHacker team leader at jloan@pierce.ctc.edu or tweet us at https://www.twitter.com/PierceHacker if you have any question, issue, or recommendations with any of our tutorial/lesson or the site itself.  A brief description in the subject line of the email/message will help speed up the response time.
#### 2.	Reporting an issue via GitHub ***(2nd choice for user.  This will probably be the 2nd most used by the users)*
This method will get the fastest response.  This method allows all of the PierceHacker team to see and respond to your issues.  Using this **(link)** will bring you to a template which you can use if you choose.  This ***(https://github.com/jloan/pierce-hacker-submissions/issues)* link will take you to the Pierce-Hacker-Submission webpage ***(hmmm are we going to use the same "issues template" that we used to review our own tutorials or do we create a simpler one for the users to use)*....
#### 3.	Making a detail suggestion **(3rd choice for user.  This would be for users that are more comfortable with GitHub or have detail suggestion or ideas for the file.)**
This method/option will allow you to leave detail comments to specific lines within the tutorial/lesson in our directory.
#### 4.	Request access to the file or a pull request **(4th and finale choice/method for user.  For more experience users who are comfortable with markdown files)**
If you feel you're experience and very familiar with GitHub and markdown files, you can make a pull request and edit/fix the tutorial/lesson yourself.  You'll make changes to the current verison
