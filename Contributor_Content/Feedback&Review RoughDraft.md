# PierceHacker Feedback **(Title Rough Draft)**
---
**(Text located in the () are just notes of what Im thinking. Temp Placeholder)
(Brief description for this page. Constructive Ideas and thoughts that user could keep in mind when providing feedback or suggestion.  Questions the user could ask themselves before providing feedback.)**

### Possible Questions and thoughts to keep in mind when providing feedback/review 
---
Here's a list of question you may want to keep in mind when providing a feedback/review of the tutorial/lesson that you are using. **(Referring to the jloan Initial review.md for groundwork for this part.)**

1.  Does the tutorial/lesson prepare you as far as what software/program was needed?
2.  Does the tutorial/lesson inform you on how much experience or how familiar you should have with the software/program you are using the guide for?
3.  Does the tutorial/lesson provide an easy to follow layout?
4.  Does the tutorial/lesson seems to long or to short?
5.  Was it organize and were you able to find the object/information you needed in a timely manner?
6.  Does the tutorial/lesson provide a reason or concept on how said lesson compares to similar lesson?
7.  Does the tutorial/lesson suggest how it could be apply other work?

### Different options/method or ways to provide feedback **(heavily influnce by The Programming Historian)**
---
**(Not sure if these steps should link of into a different tutorial/lesson or just layout some simple steps like at the PH site)** 

#### 1.	Contact information via email maybe tweet **(1st choice for user.  Most user will probably use this option/method)**
Please contact our PierceHacker team **(link to and email address maybe? Maybe Create a PierceHacker email account? I doubt Jason want his personal email to be flooded with questions)** if you have any question, issue, or recommendations with any of our tutorial/lesson or the site itself.  A brief description in the subject line of the email/message will help speed up the response time.
#### 2.	Reporting an issue using via GitHub **(2nd choice for user.  This will probably be the 2nd most used by the users)**
This method will probably get the fastest response.  This method allows all of the PierceHacker team to see and respond to your issues.  Using this link will bring you to a template .....**(hmmm are we going to use the same "issues template" that we used to review our own tutorials or do we create a simpler one for the users to use)**....
#### 3.	Making a detail suggestion **(3rd choice for user.  This would be for users that are more comfortable with GitHub or have detail suggestion or ideas for the file.)**
#### 4.	Request access to the file or a pull request **(4th and finale choice/method for user.  For more experience users who are comfortable with markdown files)**
