## Introduction
This Tutorial is designed as a guide to help students troubleshoot commonly enountered issues when doing homework in WAMAP. While not all possible issues will be covered, we will discuss frequently asked questions regarding answer submission in WAMAP. The issues we will cover have been reported as commonly encountered problems by students, tutors, and math professors.

## Section 1: Some Common Issues encountered in a Variety of Classes
### a. Parentheses: When, Where, and How Many?
Parentheses are a big deal in WAMAP, and in mathematics in general. There are a lot of situations in which parenthese can make or break your answer. Sometimes when we write down an answer on paper, it may make sense to skip the seemingly repetative parentheses, but when it comes to electronic answer submission, they are vital. As a general rule of thumb, more parentheses is typically a good idea, but there are a lot of exceptions to this. Let's take a look at an answer that might make sense to us without parantheses, but that WAMAP sees as something completely different.

In this example, not icluding parentheses in the numerator results in WAMAP completely misinterpretting the answer. Now let's check out that same problem, this time with all of the necessary parentheses.
